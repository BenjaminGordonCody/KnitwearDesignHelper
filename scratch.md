# Scratch
This is loose notes intended for me

## Questions for later
- gauge object determines the no of shaping rows using rounding. Is this going to cause problems?
- gauge object determines st counts without reference to pattern, this needs dealing with
- total st counts can't be worked out unless the distribution of larger/smaller decrease blocks has been decided. ie, much later in project. 
  - Option A: Estimate assuming equal distribution
  - Option B: Do it properly - is there a benefit to this?
